# Academic Promotion System (APS) - Frontend Redesign

## Project Overview
This project is a frontend refactoring of the **Academic Promotion System (APS)**, a governmental platform by the Egyptian Supreme Council of Universities used for managing academic promotions in Egypt. The system facilitates the preparation of **Impact Factor Reports (IF)** and **Plagiarism Reports (PR)**, ensuring a smooth transition for academics seeking promotion.

Our goal is to **modernize the user interface** while maintaining the platform's core functionalities and integrating **usability improvements** based on user research. As part of this process, we developed a **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** document that outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the system, ensuring a structured approach to the redesign.

## Features & Enhancements
- **Modern UI**: Redesigned interface based on **user analysis** to improve experience.
- **Application Management**: Intuitive dashboard for tracking **promotion applications**.
- **Improved Navigation**: Clear workflows for different user roles (Applicants, Reviewers, Admins).
- **Secure Authentication**: Enhanced login & account management.
- **Comprehensive SRS Document**: Defines system requirements and design decisions.

## UI Design & Figma Walkthrough
The **Figma prototype** was developed to refine the **user experience** and **address usability issues** identified in the previous version. A detailed **video walkthrough** of the UI is available to showcase key improvements.

## Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
We created an **SRS document** following IEEE standards to define the system's **functional requirements, user roles, and UI improvements**. The document provides a clear **roadmap for development**, ensuring alignment with user needs and institutional goals.
